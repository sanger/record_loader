# The behaviour of RuboCop can be controlled via the .rubocop.yml
# configuration file. It makes it possible to enable/disable
# certain cops (checks) and to alter their behaviour if they accept
# any parameters. The file can be placed either in your home
# directory or in some project directory.
#
# RuboCop will start looking for the configuration file in the directory
# where the inspected file is and continue its way up to the root directory.

  ExcludedMethods:
    - describe
    - context

# Increase the acceptable nesting levels. While we don't want
# 4 nested contexts, it appears that the cop is also counting
# describe. So by the time we've described out class, and the method
# we only have room for one context. Maybe this is the cops intent
# but feels a little strict to me.
